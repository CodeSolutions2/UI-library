# UI_library

The purpose of this User Interface (UI) library is to make the process of creating webapps faster and more consistant. This UI_library consists of both a css script and a javascript script using factory functions. The CSS script contains standard class notation where webapp developers can create their own webapps using the CSS script alone. The JavaScript script creates html strings that include both visual and functional code.
